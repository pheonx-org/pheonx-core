# FidoNext — Decentralized, Private, Open Communication Layer

FidoNext is a next-generation, censorship-resistant communication ecosystem built on top of a fully decentralized mesh of nodes.
No company. No servers. No phone numbers. No identity extraction.
Just pure, resilient communication — owned by people, not corporations.

FidoNext is inspired by the spirit of early decentralized networks (like FidoNET) but re-imagined for the modern world using state-of-the-art cryptography, libp2p, real-time routing, and a trust-agnostic peer-to-peer overlay.

> **FidoNext is an open, community-driven protocol for private human communication.**

## Vision

Modern messaging is centralized, surveilled, profiled and algorithmically controlled.
FidoNext aims to restore digital freedom and build a communication network that:

- Cannot be censored
- Cannot be monitored
- Cannot be owned by governments or corporations
- Cannot be shut down
- Has no servers and no single point of failure
- Is completely independent from DNS, cloud providers, and mobile operators

## Core Principles

### 1. Decentralization
FidoNext is not a service — it's a distributed protocol.
Every user running the app becomes a node in a global communication mesh.

### 2. End-to-end privacy
- Signal-grade cryptography (Double Ratchet + X3DH)
- Zero-knowledge metadata
- Onion-style routing
- Ephemeral relays

### 3. No identity extraction
- No phone numbers
- No emails
- No KYC
- No centralized identity verification
- Local, private key-based identity only

### 4. Resilience and censorship-resistance
- libp2p relay mesh
- Automatic NAT traversal
- Multi-path routing
- Self-healing network architecture

### 5. Open-source, community-owned
The project is fully open and driven by contributors.
There is no “company” behind FidoNext — only the protocol and the community.

## Phoenix Protocol

**Phoenix Protocol** — a decentralized, real-time encrypted messaging protocol built on top of libp2p.

Key elements:

- Decentralized message relay mesh
- Encrypted peer identity layer
- Secure channel establishment
- DHT-based peer discovery
- Circuit-Relay v2 routing
- Optional mixnet-style anonymization
- Metadata-minimized communication flows

## FidoNext App

The FidoNext messenger provides:

- One-tap identity creation
- Real-time encrypted chat
- Encrypted channels and groups
- Public communities
- Zero telemetry
- No phone number or email required
- P2P user discovery
- Multi-relay routing
- Offline message caching
